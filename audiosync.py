"""
Works out how far into a downloaded video the song actually starts, so it can be
lined up with the chart instead of guessing a fixed offset.

Landmark fingerprinting: find peaks in each spectrogram, hash pairs of them, then
look for a consistent time shift between the chart audio and the video audio.
Matching peak patterns instead of the raw waveform means it still works when the
YouTube rip is louder or mastered differently than the chart stems. Weak match
(live version, remix, wrong song) and it returns nothing, so the caller falls
back to the default.

Needs numpy and ffmpeg.
